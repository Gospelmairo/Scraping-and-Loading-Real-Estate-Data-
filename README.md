# Web-Scraping-Real-Estate-Data

Web Scrraping is a technique to scrape the data present on the web.

I will be scraping the real estate data from "https://nigeriapropertycentre.com/" for the properties listed for rent in Lagos State. I will scrape the first 700 pages of the listing. Each page has 20 listing so after scraping the website we should have more than 10,000 listings records.
